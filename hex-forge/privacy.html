            <section>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>hex-forge is a workout tracking app designed to help you log and optimize your hypertrophy training. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Data We Collect</h3>

                <h4>Workout Data</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exercise selections, weights, reps, and sets</li>
                    <li>Rest periods and workout duration</li>
                    <li>Mesocycle and training program configurations</li>
                    <li>Personal feedback on workouts (soreness, pump, difficulty)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Storage:</strong> Workout data is stored on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework and automatically synced to your personal iCloud account via Apple's CloudKit service. This enables your data to sync across all your devices signed into the same Apple ID. We do not have access to this data—it is stored in your private iCloud container.</p>

                <h4>HealthKit Data (Optional)</h4>
                <p>If you grant permission, hex-forge may read:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bodyweight:</strong> To auto-fill weight for bodyweight exercises</li>
                    <li><strong>Sleep data:</strong> To provide recovery recommendations</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Storage:</strong> HealthKit data is accessed read-only and is not stored separately by hex-forge. Apple manages HealthKit data according to their privacy policies.</p>

                <h4>Game Center Data (Optional)</h4>
                <p>If you enable Game Center integration:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weekly/monthly training volume scores</li>
                    <li>Workout streaks</li>
                    <li>Achievement progress</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Storage:</strong> Game Center data is managed by Apple. We submit scores to Apple's servers for leaderboard functionality.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>

                <h4>YouTube (Exercise Videos)</h4>
                <p>hex-forge displays exercise demonstration videos from YouTube to help you learn proper form. When you view a video:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your device connects directly to YouTube's servers</li>
                    <li>YouTube may collect data including your IP address, device information, and viewing activity</li>
                    <li>hex-forge does not receive any data from YouTube about your viewing activity</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Privacy-Enhanced Mode:</strong> hex-forge uses YouTube's privacy-enhanced embed domain (youtube-nocookie.com), which prevents YouTube from storing cookies on your device until you actively play a video.</p>

                <h4>YouTube Data API</h4>
                <p>hex-forge uses the YouTube Data API to search for exercise demonstration videos:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Search queries (exercise names like "Bench Press") are sent to YouTube's servers</li>
                    <li>No personal information is included in these searches</li>
                    <li>Search results are cached locally on your device to minimize API usage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For more information about how YouTube handles data, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                <h4>Firebase (Crashlytics &amp; Analytics)</h4>
                <p>hex-forge uses Google Firebase services to improve app stability and understand how features are used:</p>

                    <li>App state at time of crash (memory usage, app version)</li>
                    <li>A random installation identifier (not linked to your identity)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> collects aggregated usage data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>App opens and session duration</li>
                    <li>Feature usage (which screens are viewed)</li>
                    <li>Device type and OS version</li>
                    <li>Approximate location (country/region from IP address)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What Firebase does NOT collect:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your workout data, exercises, or personal records</li>
                    <li>Your name, email, or any personal identifiers</li>
                    <li>Advertising identifiers (IDFA)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This data helps us identify and fix crashes, and understand which features are most useful. Data is processed by Google under their <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
